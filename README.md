# Java-EE-Personal-Mini-Project

A mini project that I have been working on during my spare time. This is
a book repository where a user can search or add books to a database.
There is also an option for a admin user to login who can view all the
records in the database without having to do a manual search. The admin
can also add, delete and modify existing records in the database.

The purpose behind this project was to refamiliarise myself with some
concepts that I had learnt from Java EE from a previous Uni paper. I
made use of JSP's, Servlets, Regular Java Bean Objects, EJB's, SQL
(using JDBC). All of these components execute within the GlassFish
application server on my local machine. This project works for the most
part, there are some bugs here and there. Developed using NetBeans IDE.
